/** An envelope generator UGen similar to SuperCollider's DemandEnvGen.
  *
  * For each parameter of the envelope (levels, durations and shapes), values are
  * polled every time a new segment starts. The UGen keeps running as long as
  * level inputs are provided. If any of the other inputs terminate early, their
  * last values will be used for successive segments (e.g. one can use a constant
  * length or shape).
  *
  * Note that as a consequence of having a "hot" `levels` input,
  * the target level of the last segment may not be reached, as the UGen would
  * terminate one sample earlier. As a workaround one can duplicate the last
  * level value with a length of 1.
  *
  * The difference to `DemandEnvGen` is that this UGen does not duplicate functionality in the form
  * of `levelScale`, `levelBias`, `timeScale`, and it does not provide `reset`
  * and `gate` functionality. Durations are given as lengths in sample frames.
