/** A UGen that like `RunningMin` calculates the minimum observed value of the
  * running input. However, it operates on entire windows, i.e. it outputs
  * windows that contain the minimum elements of all the past windows observed.
  *
  * '''Warning:''' window parameter modulation is currently not working correctly (issue #30)
  *
  * @param in     the windowed signal to monitor
  * @param size   the window size. This should normally be a constant. If modulated,
  *               the internal buffer will be re-allocated, essentially causing
  *               a reset trigger.
  * @param trig   a trigger signal that clears the internal state. When a trigger
  *               is observed, the _currently processed_ window is reset altogether
  *               until its end, beginning accumulation again from the successive
  *               window. Normally one will thus want to emit a trigger in sync
  *               with the _start_ of each window. Emitting multiple triggers per
  *               window does not have any effect different from emitting the
  *               first trigger in each window.
