// XXX TODO --- we could probably use a disk-buffered variant as well for image processing

/** A UGen that transposes 2-dimensional matrices.
  * This is a 2-dimensional windowed process, where
  * each window has length `rows * columns`. Input
  * is assumed to be "left-to-right, top-to-bottom",
  * so the first samples constitute the first row,
  * the next samples constitute the second row, etc.
  *
  * ''Note:'' This is an in-place process which uses
  * less memory but possibly more time. A faster variant
  * would be to use `RotateMirrorMatrix`
  *
  * The output matrix is transposed (rows and columns
  * exchanged). So an input of `(a, b, c, d, e, f)`
  * with `rows = 2` and `columns = 3` is interpreted
  * as `((a, b, c), (d, e, f))`, transposed as
  * `((a, d), (b, e), (c, f))` and output flat as
  * `(a, d, b, e, c, f)`.
  *
  * To rotate an image ninety
  * degrees clockwise, you would have `rows = height`
  * and `columns = width`.
  *
  * @param in       the input matrices
  * @param rows     the number of rows of the _input_
  * @param columns  the number of columns of the _input_
