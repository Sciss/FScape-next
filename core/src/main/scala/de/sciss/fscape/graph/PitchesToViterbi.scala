/** A UGen that takes concurrent pitch tracker paths, and conditions them for the
  * Viterbi algorithm. The inputs are typically taken from `AutoCorrelationPitches`,
  * and from this a suitable `add` signal is produced to be used in the `Viterbi` UGen.
  * The output are matrices of size `(numIn + 1).squared`.
  *
  * '''Warning:''' This is still not thoroughly tested.
  *
  * @param lags               pitches given as sample periods, such as returned by
  *                           `AutoCorrelationPitches`.
  * @param strengths          strengths corresponding to the `lags`, such as returned by
  *                           `AutoCorrelationPitches`.
  * @param numIn              number of paths / candidates. to this the unvoiced candidate
  *                           is added
  * @param peaks              the peak amplitude of the underlying input signal, one sample per pitch frame,
  *                           used for the unvoiced candidate.
  * @param maxLag             the maximum lag time, corresponding to the minimum pitch
  * @param voicingThresh      threshold for determining whether window is voiced or unvoiced.
  * @param silenceThresh      threshold for determining whether window is background or foreground.
  * @param octaveCost         weighting factor for low versus high frequency preference.
  * @param octaveJumpCost     costs for moving pitches up and down.
  *                           to match the parameters in Praat, you should multiply
  *                           the "literature" value by `0.01 * sampleRate / stepSize`
  *                           (typically in the order of 0.25)
  * @param voicedUnvoicedCost cost for transitioning between voiced and unvoiced segments.
  *                           to match the parameters in Praat,
  *                           the "literature" value by `0.01 * sampleRate / stepSize`
  *                           (typically in the order of 0.25)
