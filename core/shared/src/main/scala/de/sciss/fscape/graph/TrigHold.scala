/** A UGen that holds an input trigger signal for a given duration.
  * When a trigger is received from `in`, the output changes from zero
  * to one for the given `length` amount of frames. If a new trigger
  * arrives within this period, the internal length counter is reset
  * (the high state is kept for further `length` frames).
  *
  * @param  in      an input trigger or gate signal. Whenever the signal
  *                 is positive, the internal hold state is reset. If a strict
  *                 trigger is needed instead of a gate signal, a `Trig` UGen
  *                 can be inserted.
  * @param  length  the number of sample frames to hold the high output once
  *                 a high input is received.
  *                 A new value is polled whenever `in` is high.
  * @param  clear   an auxiliary trigger or gate signal that resets the
  *                 output to low if there is currently no high `in`.
  *                 This signal is read synchronously with `in.`
  *                 If both `clear` and `in` are high at a given point,
  *                 then the UGen outputs high but has its length counter
  *                 reset.
