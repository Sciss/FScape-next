# Make Loop

Apply a cross-fade to a sound so that it can be seamlessly played back as a loop

This works by creating a cross-faded overlap between the beginning and ending of the sound. 
Either a piece from the beginning is cut away (= cross-fade position 
&quot;end of loop \ pre loop /&quot;) or the ending is cut away (= cross-fade position 
&quot;begin of loop / post loop \&quot;). in the former case the maximum fade length is 
determined by the initial skip setting, in the latter case the maximum fade length is 
determined by the final skip setting. the actual cross-fade length is the minimum of this 
implicit maximum length and the &quot;cross-fade length&quot; setting.

For example, with cross-fade position &quot;end of loop \ pre loop /&quot;, choosing an initial 
skip of 2 seconds and a cross-fade length of 1 second results in a sound that is 2 seconds 
shorter than the input sound, starting directly at offset 2 seconds, running right to the end 
and having a final cross-fade of one second at the very end that makes the loop work.

For strictly phase correlated signals, an &quot;equal energy&quot; fade type is provided, 
however usually signals are not correlated and you use &quot;equal power&quot; to approximately 
maintain original loudness during the cross-fade.
