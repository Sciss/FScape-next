/** A band-limited resampling UGen.
  *
  * It uses an internal table for the anti-aliasing filter.
  * Table resolution is currently fixed at 4096 filter samples per zero crossing and
  * linear interpolation in the FIR table, but the total filter length can be specified
  * through the `zeroCrossings` parameter. Note: If filter parameters are changed, the
  * table must be recalculated which is very expensive. However, `factor` modulation
  * is efficient.
  *
  * __Note:__ Unlike most other UGens, all parameters but `in` are read at "output rate".
  * That is particular important for `factor` modulation. For each frame output, one
  * frame from `factor` is consumed.
  *
  * @param in             the signal to resample
  * @param factor         the resampling factor, where values greater than one
  *                       mean the signal is stretched (sampling-rate increases or pitch lowers)
  *                       and values less than one mean the signal is condensed (sampling-rate decreases
  *                       or pitch rises)
  * @param minFactor      the minimum expected resampling factor, which controls
  *                       the amount of buffering needed for the input signal. This is used at
  *                       initialization time only. The default
  *                       value of zero makes the UGen settles on the first `factor` value encountered.
  *                       It is possible to use a value actually higher than the lowest provided
  *                       `factor`, in order to limit the buffer usage. In that case, the FIR anti-aliasing
  *                       filter will be truncated.
  * @param rollOff        the FIR anti-aliasing roll-off width
  * @param kaiserBeta     the FIR windowing function's parameter
  * @param zeroCrossings  the number of zero-crossings in the truncated and windowed sinc FIR.
