# Branching

We want to be able to create branches so that only one of them is actually executed. This is mostly needed for
dynamic adjustment based on initial conditions such as passing in a predicate from the outside (SoundProcesses).

Now, because there is no global stream of data, sampling rate, block size, etc., it's impossible (or at least
extremely hard) to 'pause' and 'resume' a sub-graph correctly. On top of that, Akka does not allow the runtime
modification of the graph.

So let us create a mechanism that supports the following:

- a conditional element that can determine from the first value of its predicate input stream, whether
  a sub-branch is executed or not

```
  val in0 = AudioFileIn(...)
  val in = If ("filter".attr(false)) {
    HPF(in0, 1000.0/sr)
  } Else {
    in0
  }
  AudioFileOut(in * gain)
```

Perhaps the easiest way to achieve this, is to consider the entire graph

```
                     _______________
                    [AudioFileIn____]
                     |_______________
                    [Broadcast______]
                     |           |
    "filter".attr    |           HPF
     |_______________|___________|__
    [If_____________________________] 
     |
    AudioFileOut

```

What we must avoid is the currently "normal" behaviour of all elements, including AudioFileIn, to start tasking
right away, even at the absence of pulls from sinks, they may start polling data of their inlets. So the `If`
would be constructed to first wait for the first package for the predicate, then determine whether it starts
polling the `if` or the `else` branch. When it does that, it will close the other inlet, allowing thus the dead
branch to shut down as well. So it's vital that the elements still install their handlers immediately, but that
they refrain from polling inputs. It would be great if `If` could send the active branch an initialisation message
indeed, so we don't need to move the initialisation check into the output handlers.

Can we run into a deadlock? Such as `"filter".attr` being used in one of the branches? I think the injected
`broadcast` would always include one block of buffering.

--------

There are side-effecting elements, say `Poll`. We need to capture those. All elements that need explicit expansion
are using `Lazy.Expander` and thus `Graph.builder.addLazy(this)`. Expansion is two steps: `GE` to `UGenInLike` 
to `StreamOut`. The latter produces `Node` which upon `createLogic` of its parent graph stage calls
`control.addNode`, which would be the place to collect the nodes into branch specific collections, so that we
can then call a kind of "launch"; probably using `getAsyncCallback`.

## `ElseGE`

So how to get from `ElseUnit` to `ElseGE`? In the former, we "forgot" about the branch graphs. We waited for the
predicate to be decidable and then either launched or completed (stopped) the layers associated with the branches.

In the latter, we'll collect the `result: GE` fields and handle their streams into the `IfThenGE` graph stage logic.
The crucial timing bit will be when to `pull` the selected branch's result after having launched it. If that happens
too early, we might not have initialised the branch yet. Probably we should create a resulting `Future[Unit]` from
`launchLayer`, or pass it a call-back function. As was confirmed on the Akka gitter, it is allowed to install
handlers at any point.

## 16-Mar-2019

This graph:

```
  val g = Graph {
    import graph._
    val sig0  = ArithmSeq(length = 4000)
    val sig   = If (0: GE) Then {
      sig0
    } Else {
      sig0 + 1
    }

    Length(sig).poll(0, "len")
  }
```

The problem is that we do _not_ have `sig0` in the first layer of the `IfThenGE`, which means that the
`completeLayer` call does nothing. In turn, the `sig0` is still "connected" to the first branch through the
synthetic broad-cast-buf. Currently, the broad-cast-buf will not deliver if not all outputs have been pulled.
So we get into a deadlock.

In the actual example, we do have an intermediate `Map` (long-to-double), and that is currently not a `NodeImpl`
and thus also not shut down. A quick solution is to have `Map` obey `NodeImpl`, but in reality we need to handle
the case where that intermediate element is not inserted, and thus one of the if-then-else branches is connected
directly to a broad-cast-buf, which in the current architecture cannot be registered as `NodeImpl`.

Therefore, because shitty Akka does not expose API to close particular connections, but only to complete an entire
node, we would have to insert forwarder flows (piping one input to one output) at each branch, so that these
pipes can be shut down if needed. We would still have to call `completeLayer` because there may be closed sub-graphs,
e.g. polling and other side effects.

--------

## MCE

Because we can have "closed" sub-graphs within a branch, there is really no way we could propagate MCE to outer 
levels. Like

```
   val sig1: GE = DC(Seq(1, 2))
   val sig2: GE = DC(Seq(1, 2))
   if (1: GE) Then { sig1 } Else {
     (123: GE).poll(0, "Henlo)
     sig2
   }
```

Surely we don't want the poll to be instantiated two times. On the other hand, having multi-channel conditions for
the `If` is difficult to understand. We should _forbid_ that possibility, by either dropping all channels but the 
first, or by reducing the channels (if necessary) using an AND or OR operator. This must be documented as a
convention. If one _really_ wants mce, one could still use a `Seq.tabulate` and then have multiple `If` elements
generated inside.
