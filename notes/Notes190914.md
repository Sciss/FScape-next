# Notes 190914

## Recursive processes

The example being that we want to "fold" a signal, like so:

```
object GE {
  def fold(in: GE, n: GE)(fun: GE => GE): GE
}

((0 until 10): GE).foldLeft(sigIn) { case (prev0, i) =>
  val prev    = prev0.elastic() // probably need to add DelayN-time
  val stretch = Rubberband(prev0, 1.05)
  val freq    = i.linExp(0, 10, 5000, 50)
  prev + DelayN(LPF(stretch, freq), 0.1 * sr)
}
```

Of course, this is again unrolling the individual iterations; this is how it's done
in Patterns, but it's unclear if we can do the same thing with Akka Stream. It's
really unfortunate that we cannot expand sub-trees at rendering time.

----------

Can we find a way not to eagerly unroll the fold? What would be an imperative rewrite of that loop?

```
val fb      = Feedback(sigIn)
val prev0   = fb.in
val prev    = prev0.elastic()
val i       = RepeatWindow(0 until 10, n = sigSize)
val stretch = Rubberband(prev0, 1.05)
val freq    = i.linExp(0, 10, 5000, 50)
val next    = prev + DelayN(LPF(stretch, freq), 0.1 * sr) // not correct, just for the sake of the example
fb.out(next)
next.take(sigSize * 10)
```

This of course would additionally need an explicit delay time between feedback in and out,
and we could use `BlockSize(1) { ... }` to locally set the block size down to single samples if needed.
